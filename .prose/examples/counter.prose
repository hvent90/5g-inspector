# Counter Component
# A simple interactive counter to demonstrate OpenProse basics

## Requirements

Create a counter component with the following behavior:

1. Display the current count value, starting at 0
2. Show an "Increment" button that adds 1 to the count
3. Show a "Decrement" button that subtracts 1 from the count
4. Show a "Reset" button that sets the count back to 0
5. The count should never go below 0

## Styling

- Center the component on the page
- Use a large font for the count display
- Space the buttons evenly below the count

## Tech Stack

- Use React with TypeScript
- Use Base UI for button components
- Use Effect for state management
